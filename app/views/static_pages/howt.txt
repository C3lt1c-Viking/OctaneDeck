    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">OctaneDeck Vision</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    The creator of OctaneDeck (C3lt1c Viking) has a vision to create a new social
    media website that does not track or harvest your data. The world is saturated
    with other social media sites that includes LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. and
    they all track your cookies, offline activities, GPS tracking, and more.
    With CryptoDeck, you get raw unrestricted social media aspect just like Tom Anderson (Founder of MySpace)
    had intended it to be.<br/>
    However, we want to twist things up a little bit...<br/>
    With the rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, we also want to share that option with everyone.
    By investing time &amp; resources into CryptoDeck, we are looking into "Tipping" each other
    with cryptocoins. Not all accounts will be subjected to this, and we will discuss this more in a few moments.
    On top of that, we also provide "Badges" for users as well to help promote each other!<br/>
    And this is where we brought in another developer to assist in speeding up the process! With
    another developer (GhostKanyi) on board, we have the ability to be able to create and publish
    OctaneDeck much faster. Thus allowing users to be able to utilize our social media site as soon
    as possible!
    <br/>
    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">Basics of Social Media & OctaneDeck</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    While social media can be the ultimate form in sharing updates with our friends &amp; family,
    it is another to use these free services to harvest data. CryptoDeck aims to provide everyone
    with a basic social media experience and not have to worry about being tracked. **EVER**!
    With CryptoDeck, you can create your "Deck" (AKA Profile), and then add content as you desire.
    Such content can include;<br/>
    * First Name<br/>
    * Last Name<br/>
    * Username (Required)<br/>
    * Email (Required)<br/>
    * Hobbies<br/>
    * Job Title<br/>
    * Company<br/>
    * Education<br/>
    * Bitcoin Address<br/>
    * Dogecoin Address<br/>
    * Ethereum Address<br/>
    * Facebook Page<br/>
    * Twitter Page<br/>
    * GitHub Page<br/>
    * Stackoverflow Page<br/>
    * Other Website<br/>
    * Phone Number<br/>
    * Marital Status<br/>
    * Humanoid Traits (Male | Female)<br/>
    * Interested In (Friends | Connecting | Relationship)<br/>
    * Password (Required)<br/>
    On top of sharing selected information with users, you will also be able to follow each other as well
    and get updates of your friends on your personal feed! Just like a regular social media experience!<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">Cryptocurrencies & More</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    By utilizing Coinbase API Keys, CryptoDeck aims to allow users to connect to their accounts and be able
    to send cryptocurrencies among each other. This will also be our block foundation for allowing the "Tips"
    to be carried out as well!
    We have put a lot of time &amp; research into this program, and are eager to help increase the ease of usage
    for anyone. But by utilizing Coinbase API keys, we have the ability to be able to help each other grow and
    pay each other with cryptocurrencies!<br/>
    <br/>
    <u><b>This section will be updated when we start integrating Coinbase into OctaneDeck!</b></u><br/>
    <br/>
    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">Tipping</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    With the rise of Tipping your influencers, OctaneDeck now makes it easier than ever to tip your
    favorite individuals! However, not everyone will be qualified for Tipping.
    What does it take to become Tip Illegible?
    First, one would have to create at least 1,000 posts, and have a minimum of 1,000 followers.
    However, the content would be viewed to determine if one is illegible for tipping. Content **CAN NOT** include
    any of the following;<br/>
    * Sexual Graphics or Content<br/>
    * Blasphemy Against Religion/Politics/Other Users<br/>
    * Hate Speeches or Crime<br/>
    <br/>
    While we are working hard on making the ultimate safe &amp; secured social media site,
    we also want individuals to enjoy their experience as well.
    <br/>
    When one is granted "Tipping" status, that individual will have a new Badge on their
    Deck wall, as well as a new button that says "Tip Me". And this will allow users
    to tip those whom are illegible for tipping.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">Badges</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    Everyone loves badges! And we do too! This is a new system that we are working on integrating
    into CryptoDeck and will be actively monitoring it. As of now, badges are awarded for;<br/>
    * Account Creation<br/>
    * 10 Posts Created<br/>
    * 50 Posts Created<br/>
    * 100 Posts Created<br/>
    * 10 Followers<br/>
    * 50 Followers<br/>
    * 100 Followers<br/>
    As we get more ideas for more badges, we will include them into this setup as well.<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong style="color: #0F0; font-size: 35px;">Contributions & Donations</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    It takes a lot to keep OctaneDeck up and going. What we are looking for right now, is
    an alpha server to deploy too and the purchase of the domain name. Currently, we are trying
    to raise $150 USD in order to secure our domain name & hosting services for the Alpha server.
    <br/>
    If you would like to make a donation, we accept donations via Cryptocurrencies;
    * Bitcoin Donations:

    * Ethereum Donations:

    like to be apart of this project, please send an email to the developer;
